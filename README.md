# ADHelpMe_Term_Project

This is my term project for a cloud computing course. The website is by no means finished or perfect given the time restraints. The purpose of the assignment was to plan out, develop, then deploy a web app serving a real world purpose. The objective of my web app is to raise awareness about ADHD and provide an easy place to find information about ADHD. Due to the nature of ADHD, many adults go through their lives with out ever learning that they are affected by ADHD. In addition, the information and research focusing on ADHD is still evolving making finding good information difficult. My hope is to make finding that information and deciding whether to go through the diagnosis process easier for anyone who believes they or a loved one may have ADHD.

# Current Features
Currently in the bare bones web app the following is offered:
- A login page for user authentication.
- A registration page for creating a new user. User role can be selected there for testing purposes.
- A landing page with very basic information about the 3 features planned. Currently only the quiz feature is developed.
- The quizzes home page provides 3 options: finding a quiz, creating a quiz, and reviewing taken quizzes
- The find a quiz page allows users to filter results using a basic search bar, and then take a quiz in the list of quizzes
- The create a quiz page using basic forms to generate questions for the quiz. Currently only multiple choice questions are implemented.
- The review a quiz page allows users to view old quizzes in a simalar window as when taking a quiz. However, the given answer and correct answer are also provided in the question window.

# Planned Features
There were many more features planned for the web app, but time constraints in my class prevented me from getting to them all.

Informational Page:
- The info page would contain educational information about ADHD, the diagnosis process, and medications / treatments for ADHD.
- There are many good books and videos about these three subjects, so a further reading and video section is planned as well.
- Beyond the above, I am hesitant to add a forum feature to allow users to talk about ADHD. In addition to it being hard to find information about ADHD, there is also a lot of misinformation.

Tools page:

The third section I planned was a tools section for helping manage ADHD symptoms. Here is a list of tools I planned for this section.
- A time management tool to plan out work and break periods using a timer. Users would be allowed to create presets and plans. A preset would be a work and break time period pair, and a plan would be a combination of those presets.
- A calender merged with task and time managment tools. For task management, users would be allowed to create tasks. Each task would include a ranking of importance, a time to start the task, and a time that the task must be finished by. Using the rankings, start time, and finish time, a todo list will be generated for the current day with the most important tasks that have the closest deadlines at the top. A difficulty value could also be added to provide more options to filter the todo list. The calendar would use the finish time to create lists of tasks in each day window.
- A user driven section with guides to manage ADHD. This section would allow users to create guides and upload files along with those guides. An example could be a user talking about a unique template they made to help plan out their day along with the template included in the file section. Another example could be A user talking through how the set up routines with a link to a YouTube video that inspired them. The biggest issue would be finding a good way to implement searching and filtering these guides. Possibilities include filtering by the symptoms the guide is supposed to help with or filtering by the type of media included such as templates, videos, or plan text guides.

Finally, a way to moderate the user driven sections of the web app has to be determined. Given that this is a developed by only me, I would initally want a way to flag possibly malicious user submitted items for review before they are posted to their respective page. However, a better solution would have to be developed down the line if the web app is finished and gains popularity.
